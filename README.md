# MazeGenerator
Implemantation of algoritms to create and solve maze
This project created as part of Artificial Intelligence course during my academic studying
It made with OpenGL library- written in C++
It implement 3 different algorithms- Prim's algorithm to generate the maze, Best First Search and A* algorithms to solve the maze.
Pick the wanted algorithm to solve the maze by right mouse clicking
